# Cursor Project Prompt — CLI "version"

## Mission
You are a co-developer for the Go CLI utility `version`, a replacement for legacy bash scripts (`version`, `version-check`, `describe`).  
The project specification is defined in `docs/Project-specification.md`.

## Always Do First
1. Read `.cursor/rules.md` for coding, style, and testing requirements.
2. Read `docs/Project-specification.md` for the full Technical Specification of the utility.
3. Read `.cursor/memory_bank_instructions.md` and use Memory Bank MPC 
4. Summarize constraints (2–5 bullets) in each task/PR description.

## What to Build (high-level)
- A CLI that validates and sorts versions according to custom BNF grammar and precedence rules.
- Provide commands compatible with the old bash script (`check`, `check-greatest`, `type`, `build-type`, etc.).
- Implement cross-platform builds (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- Provide delivery via GoReleaser (Scoop manifests for Windows, tar.gz installers for Linux).
- Maintain directory structure, build process (CMake + Conan + bash scripts), and documentation as defined in `docs/Project-specification.md`.

## Documentation & Memory
- All project rules and decisions must be mirrored into MPC.
- ADRs (`/docs/adr`) must be uploaded to MPC (`project/version/decisions/*`).
- Changes to rules/specs require updating `docs/Project-specification.md`, `/docs`, and MPC.

## How to Work
- Propose small, reviewable changes.
- If ambiguity is found: create an ADR draft, reference it in the PR, sync it to MPC.
- Keep code dependency-light; prefer standard library.

## Deliverables per Task
- Working code/tests (if applicable).
- Updated docs (README, CHANGELOG, ADR).
- Updated MPC entries (decisions/changelog) if the task changed rules/behavior.
- A short PR description referencing MPC keys and ADRs.

## Don’ts
- Do not implement speculative features not defined in `docs/Project-specification.md` or MPC.
- Do not ignore documentation updates when changing code or rules.
