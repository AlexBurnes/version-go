## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Language Choice**: Go is already decided and specified in project requirements
- **Build System**: CMake + Conan + bash scripts as specified in project.md
- **Distribution**: GoReleaser for cross-platform builds and distribution
- **Linux Packaging**: Makeself for self-extracting archives with professional installation experience ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Windows Packaging**: Scoop package manager for easy installation and updates ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **macOS Packaging**: Makeself for self-extracting archives with professional installation experience ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Installer Naming**: Clean version numbers without SNAPSHOT and hex abbreviations ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Installation Approach**: No-sudo internal usage - users run with sudo if needed ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Build Script**: Automatic Go environment setup and .env file loading ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive platform-specific installation guides ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Custom Installation**: Support for custom installation directories via APP_DIR environment variable ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Grammar**: Custom BNF grammar extending SemVer 2.0 with prerelease, postrelease, and intermediate identifiers
- **Compatibility**: Must maintain 100% compatibility with existing bash script interfaces

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First**: All decisions and patterns must be documented in Memory Bank
- **Cross-platform**: All code must work identically on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Prefer standard library, avoid external dependencies unless justified
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests required
- **Exit Codes**: POSIX-compliant exit codes (0 for success, >=1 for errors)
- **Library Design**: Core functionality should be reusable as library package
- **API Design**: Clean, well-documented public API with comprehensive examples

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project has clear, well-defined requirements in project.md
- Existing bash scripts provide a reference implementation to maintain compatibility
- Custom grammar requirements mean standard SemVer libraries cannot be used directly
- Build system complexity requires careful setup with CMake, Conan, and GoReleaser integration
