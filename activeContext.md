# Active Context: Version CLI Utility

## Current Work Focus
**PROJECT COMPLETED WITH LIBRARY REFACTORING AND BUILD SYSTEM FIXES** - Successfully implemented complete Go CLI utility replacing legacy bash scripts. All core functionality, testing, and build system integration is complete and working. Additionally, refactored core functionality into a reusable library package for use by other utilities. Version 0.5.2 includes critical fixes to the Conan build system for reliable local development and GoReleaser integration verification.

## Recent Changes
- **COMPLETED**: Full Go implementation with custom regex-based version parser
- **COMPLETED**: Colored output system matching bash script patterns (error=red, success=green, debug=yellow)
- **COMPLETED**: All CLI commands (project, module, version, release, full, check, check-greatest, type, build-type, sort)
- **COMPLETED**: Git integration for version extraction and project information
- **COMPLETED**: Version sorting and comparison with correct precedence rules
- **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive test suite with 25.7% coverage, all tests passing
- **COMPLETED**: CMake build system integration with cross-platform support
- **COMPLETED**: Static binary builds for Linux/amd64 with full functionality
- **COMPLETED**: README.md and CHANGELOG.md documentation
- **COMPLETED**: Memory bank updates reflecting final implementation
- **FIXED**: Version type command now returns lowercase output (release, prerelease, postrelease, intermediate)
- **FIXED**: Prerelease regex updated to use ~ delimiter for RPM naming rules compliance
- **FIXED**: Added git tag conversion from x.y.z-(remainder) to x.y.z~(remainder) format
- **FIXED**: Updated all tests to reflect corrected behavior and regex patterns
- **NEW**: Refactored core functionality into reusable library package (pkg/version)
- **NEW**: Created comprehensive library API with exported types and functions
- **NEW**: Added library documentation (docs/LIBRARY.md) with usage examples
- **NEW**: Created minimal example demonstrating library usage (examples/basic/)
- **NEW**: Updated CLI to use library package while maintaining full compatibility
- **FIXED (v0.5.1)**: Conan build script critical issues resolved for reliable local builds
- **FIXED (v0.5.1)**: Version detection now uses git describe instead of non-existent scripts
- **FIXED (v0.5.1)**: Source directory references corrected from src/ to cmd/version/
- **FIXED (v0.5.1)**: Conan file path issues resolved for proper dependency management
- **FIXED (v0.5.1)**: CMake preset path issues fixed for correct build configuration
- **FIXED (v0.5.1)**: Build directory path corrected for proper binary placement
- **FIXED (v0.5.1)**: Static build target working directory fixed
- **VERIFIED (v0.5.2)**: GoReleaser build system with Conan hooks fully functional and tested
- **VERIFIED (v0.5.2)**: Cross-platform builds working for all target platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- **VERIFIED (v0.5.2)**: Conan profile detection respects existing profiles without overwriting
- **VERIFIED (v0.5.2)**: Apache 2.0 license properly integrated for distribution

## Next Steps
- **PROJECT READY FOR USE**: All core functionality implemented and tested with library support
- **LIBRARY READY**: Core version functionality available as reusable library package
- **BUILD SYSTEM READY**: Conan build script fully functional for local development and cross-platform builds
- Consider additional features based on user feedback
- Monitor for any edge cases in version parsing
- Prepare for distribution via GoReleaser when ready

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Language Choice**: Go is already decided and specified in project requirements
- **Build System**: CMake + Conan + bash scripts as specified in project.md
- **Distribution**: GoReleaser for cross-platform builds and distribution
- **Linux Packaging**: Makeself for self-extracting archives with professional installation experience
- **Windows Packaging**: Scoop package manager for easy installation and updates
- **Grammar**: Custom BNF grammar extending SemVer 2.0 with prerelease, postrelease, and intermediate identifiers
- **Compatibility**: Must maintain 100% compatibility with existing bash script interfaces

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First**: All decisions and patterns must be documented in Memory Bank
- **Cross-platform**: All code must work identically on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Prefer standard library, avoid external dependencies unless justified
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests required
- **Exit Codes**: POSIX-compliant exit codes (0 for success, >=1 for errors)
- **Library Design**: Core functionality should be reusable as library package
- **API Design**: Clean, well-documented public API with comprehensive examples

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project has clear, well-defined requirements in project.md
- Existing bash scripts provide a reference implementation to maintain compatibility
- Custom grammar requirements mean standard SemVer libraries cannot be used directly
- Build system complexity requires careful setup with CMake, Conan, and GoReleaser integration
