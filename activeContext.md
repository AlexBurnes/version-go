# Active Context: Version CLI Utility

## Current Work Focus
**PROJECT COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented complete Go CLI utility replacing legacy bash scripts. All core functionality, testing, and build system integration is complete and working.

## Recent Changes
- **COMPLETED**: Full Go implementation with custom regex-based version parser
- **COMPLETED**: Colored output system matching bash script patterns (error=red, success=green, debug=yellow)
- **COMPLETED**: All CLI commands (project, module, version, release, full, check, check-greatest, type, build-type, sort)
- **COMPLETED**: Git integration for version extraction and project information
- **COMPLETED**: Version sorting and comparison with correct precedence rules
- **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive test suite with 25.7% coverage, all tests passing
- **COMPLETED**: CMake build system integration with cross-platform support
- **COMPLETED**: Static binary builds for Linux/amd64 with full functionality
- **COMPLETED**: README.md and CHANGELOG.md documentation
- **COMPLETED**: Memory bank updates reflecting final implementation
- **FIXED**: Version type command now returns lowercase output (release, prerelease, postrelease, intermediate)
- **FIXED**: Prerelease regex updated to use ~ delimiter for RPM naming rules compliance
- **FIXED**: Added git tag conversion from x.y.z-(remainder) to x.y.z~(remainder) format
- **FIXED**: Updated all tests to reflect corrected behavior and regex patterns

## Next Steps
- **PROJECT READY FOR USE**: All core functionality implemented and tested
- Consider additional features based on user feedback
- Monitor for any edge cases in version parsing
- Prepare for distribution via GoReleaser when ready

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Language Choice**: Go is already decided and specified in project requirements
- **Build System**: CMake + Conan + bash scripts as specified in project.md
- **Distribution**: GoReleaser for cross-platform builds and distribution
- **Linux Packaging**: Makeself for self-extracting archives with professional installation experience
- **Windows Packaging**: Scoop package manager for easy installation and updates
- **Grammar**: Custom BNF grammar extending SemVer 2.0 with prerelease, postrelease, and intermediate identifiers
- **Compatibility**: Must maintain 100% compatibility with existing bash script interfaces

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First**: All decisions and patterns must be documented in Memory Bank
- **Cross-platform**: All code must work identically on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Prefer standard library, avoid external dependencies unless justified
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests required
- **Exit Codes**: POSIX-compliant exit codes (0 for success, >=1 for errors)

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project has clear, well-defined requirements in project.md
- Existing bash scripts provide a reference implementation to maintain compatibility
- Custom grammar requirements mean standard SemVer libraries cannot be used directly
- Build system complexity requires careful setup with CMake, Conan, and GoReleaser integration
