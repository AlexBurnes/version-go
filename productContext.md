# Product Context: Version CLI Utility

## Problem Statement
Current build pipelines rely on legacy bash scripts (`version`, `version-check`, `describe`) that are:
- Platform-specific and difficult to maintain across Linux, Windows, and macOS
- Limited in their version parsing capabilities (basic SemVer only)
- Prone to inconsistencies across different environments
- Hard to distribute and install consistently
- Lacking proper error handling and exit codes

These limitations create friction in CI/CD workflows and make version management inconsistent across development teams and deployment environments.

## User Experience Goals
- **Developers**: Simple, consistent CLI interface that works identically across all platforms
- **CI/CD Systems**: Reliable exit codes and predictable behavior for automated builds
- **DevOps Teams**: Easy installation and distribution through standard package managers
- **Build Engineers**: Support for complex version formats beyond standard SemVer
- **Cross-platform Users**: Single tool that works seamlessly on Linux, Windows, and macOS

## Success Metrics
- **Compatibility**: 100% feature parity with existing bash scripts
- **Performance**: Handle large version lists (10k+ versions) without significant slowdown
- **Reliability**: Zero false positives/negatives in version validation
- **Distribution**: Successful installation via Scoop (Windows) and tar.gz (Linux)
- **Adoption**: Seamless replacement of bash scripts in existing build pipelines
