# Progress: Version CLI Utility

## What Works
- **✅ PROJECT COMPLETE WITH LIBRARY**: Full Go CLI utility implementation with reusable library package
- **✅ Go Module Structure**: Proper Go module structure with clean architecture
- **✅ CLI Framework**: Complete command parsing and routing system
- **✅ Library Package**: Reusable `pkg/version` package with comprehensive API
- **✅ Version Parser**: Custom regex-based BNF grammar engine supporting extended version formats
- **✅ Version Validator**: Comprehensive input validation with detailed error reporting
- **✅ Version Sorter**: Correct sorting algorithm with proper precedence rules
- **✅ Git Integration**: Full git tag reading and version extraction functionality
- **✅ Command Implementation**: All CLI commands implemented and tested
- **✅ Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and library tests
- **✅ Colored Output**: Terminal-friendly colored output matching bash script patterns
- **✅ Build System**: CMake integration with cross-platform builds working
- **✅ Static Binaries**: Linux/amd64 static binary builds successful
- **✅ Documentation**: Complete README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and library documentation
- **✅ Memory Bank**: Updated with final implementation details
- **✅ Library Examples**: Minimal example demonstrating library usage
- **✅ Conan Build System (v0.5.1)**: Fully functional local build system with dependency management
- **✅ Cross-Platform Builds (v0.5.1)**: All platform binaries building successfully via Conan
- **✅ GoReleaser Integration (v0.5.2)**: Cross-platform build and distribution system fully functional
- **✅ Conan Hooks (v0.5.2)**: GoReleaser hooks properly install and deploy build tools via Conan
- **✅ Distribution Artifacts (v0.5.2)**: All platform archives and binaries generated correctly
- **✅ Makeself Installers (v0.5.3)**: Self-extracting installers for Linux and macOS with professional branding
- **✅ Scoop Integration (v0.5.3)**: Windows package manager integration with proper manifest generation
- **✅ Clean Naming (v0.5.3)**: Installer naming uses clean version numbers without SNAPSHOT/hex suffixes
- **✅ No-Sudo Approach (v0.5.3)**: Install scripts don't use sudo internally - users run with sudo if needed

## What's Left to Build
- **PROJECT COMPLETE**: All core functionality implemented and tested with library support
- **LIBRARY COMPLETE**: Reusable library package with comprehensive API and documentation
- **BUILD SYSTEM COMPLETE (v0.5.1)**: Conan build system fully functional for local development
- **PACKAGING COMPLETE (v0.5.3)**: Makeself and Scoop distribution systems implemented and tested
- **Future Enhancements**: Additional features based on user feedback
- **Distribution**: GoReleaser integration for automated releases (when ready)

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **✅ RESOLVED**: Legacy bash scripts analyzed and compatibility maintained
- **✅ RESOLVED**: Custom BNF grammar successfully implemented with regex-based parser
- **✅ RESOLVED**: CMake + Conan + Go integration working correctly
- **✅ RESOLVED**: Cross-platform behavior verified through comprehensive testing
- **✅ RESOLVED**: Performance optimized for large version lists (10k+ versions)
- **✅ RESOLVED (v0.5.1)**: Conan build script critical issues fixed for reliable local builds

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Project requirements fully implemented from `project.md`
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Memory Bank system established and maintained throughout development
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Modular CLI architecture implemented with clean separation of concerns
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Go + CMake + Conan + GoReleaser technology stack confirmed and working
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Multi-platform distribution strategy planned and ready for implementation
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Custom version parser implemented avoiding semver library complexity
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Colored output system matching bash script patterns
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Comprehensive testing with library tests and race detection
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Static binary builds working for Linux/amd64
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Full documentation including README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and library docs
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Library refactoring with reusable `pkg/version` package
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Library API design with comprehensive examples and documentation
