# Progress: Version CLI Utility

## What Works
- **Project Documentation**: Comprehensive project specification in `project.md`
- **Memory Bank System**: Complete Memory Bank structure established
- **Build System Design**: CMake + Conan + GoReleaser architecture defined
- **Requirements Definition**: Clear functional and non-functional requirements
- **Distribution Strategy**: Scoop (Windows) and tar.gz (Linux) distribution planned
- **Packaging Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for Linux (makeself) and Windows (Scoop) packaging
- **Build Documentation**: Complete build guide covering both local and packaging builds
- **Build Scripts**: build-conan.sh for local builds, build-goreleaser.sh for packaging builds
- **GoReleaser Integration**: Conan hooks for automated cross-platform builds
- **Installation Scripts**: Linux install.sh script with flexible installation options
- **Scoop Manifest**: Windows package configuration with multi-architecture support

## What's Left to Build
- **Go Module Setup**: Initialize proper Go module in `src/` directory
- **CLI Framework**: Implement command parsing and routing
- **Version Parser**: Custom BNF grammar engine for extended version formats
- **Version Validator**: Input validation and error handling
- **Version Sorter**: Sorting algorithm with precedence rules
- **Git Integration**: Git tag reading and version extraction
- **Command Implementation**: All CLI commands (`check`, `check-greatest`, `type`, etc.)
- **Testing Suite**: Unit tests, integration tests, and test data
- **Makeself Integration**: Automated Linux package creation
- **Scoop Integration**: Automated Windows package updates

## Known Issues and Limitations
- **Legacy Code**: Existing bash scripts in `src/old/` need analysis for compatibility requirements
- **Grammar Complexity**: Custom BNF grammar extends beyond SemVer 2.0, requiring careful implementation
- **Build Complexity**: CMake + Conan + Go integration may require significant setup
- **Cross-platform Testing**: Need to ensure identical behavior across Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Performance Requirements**: Large version list sorting needs optimization

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Phase**: Project started with clear requirements from `project.md`
- **Memory Bank Setup**: Established comprehensive documentation system for project continuity
- **Architecture Planning**: Designed modular CLI architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Technology Stack**: Confirmed Go + CMake + Conan + GoReleaser stack based on requirements
- **Distribution Strategy**: Planned multi-platform distribution via Scoop and tar.gz packages
- **Packaging Documentation**: Created comprehensive guides for both Linux (makeself) and Windows (Scoop) packaging approaches
- **Build Documentation**: Created comprehensive build guide covering both local development and packaging builds
- **Build Scripts**: Implemented build-conan.sh for local builds and build-goreleaser.sh for packaging builds
- **GoReleaser Integration**: Documented and implemented Conan hooks for automated cross-platform builds
- **Installation Experience**: Designed flexible installation options for both system-wide and user-local installation
